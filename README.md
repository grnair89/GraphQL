# GraphQL - A faster Subgraph Isomorphism algorithm

## What is this?

The aim of this project is to implement various subgraph isomorphism algorithms
and related techniques implemented in the GraphQL paper along with the optimizations
mentioned in the following sections from the paper on the Neo4j graph database.

1. Section 4.2 Local Pruning and retrieval of Feasible Mates
2. Section 4.3 Joint Reduction of search space

## Getting Started

1. Download Protein dataset and install neo4j
2. Copy project files
3. $ ./start_csruntime.sh
4. $ python Director.py from a single node with active csruntime
