# GraphQL - A Subgraph Isomorphism algorithm

## What is this?

The aim of this project is to implement various subgraph isomorphism algorithms
and related techniques implemented in the GraphQL[1] paper along with the optimizations
mentioned in the following sections from the paper on the Neo4j graph database.

1. Section 4.2 Local Pruning and retrieval of Feasible Mates
2. Section 4.3 Joint Reduction of search space

## Getting Started

1. Download the Protein dataset and follow instructions on how to use the target and query graphs.
2. Install Neo4j Graph database and use the java driver to connect to the database - https://neo4j.com/developer/java/
3. Execute the java file to create the database graph from the dataset
4. Specify the query graph to get started with searching
